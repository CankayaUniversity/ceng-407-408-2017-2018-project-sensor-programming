To install the app, firstly, you must have Google Play installed on your Android Device.

If you have Google Play installed, you need to download the application called Arduino Bluetooth Controller.

To be able to connect to the application, Bluetooth must be turned on.

Figure shows how we can change buttons. 

As shown in the picture, when we click on the symbol in the upper right corner, we can assign the desired value to the buttons. 

When we press the Start button, the program starts running. With the Select key, we can select the desired key.

The keys and values we assign in our project are as follows:
